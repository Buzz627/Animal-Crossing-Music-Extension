# Animal Crossing Music
Animal Crossing Music is a a fun Chrome extension for playing Animal Crossing's
music in the browser, while you work, play or browse the web! âœ¨

The music updates in real-time on the hour, and informs you via an optional
desktop notification and customizable town tune! ðŸŒ±

## Development

### Change of Hands

[JdotCarver](https://github.com/jdotcarver) has loved this project from the very
start, but feels he has held onto it for too long. He's had the purest
intentions and has always been a fan, but with different time commitments, he
doesn't want this project to turn bad. With Animal Crossing coming out on Switch
and people gaining interest again, there's hopes the project could be revived
and more good things could come out of this.

If you are a
true fan and want to share your passion for Animal Crossing with our fellow
villagers, please create an
[issue](https://github.com/animal-crossing-music-extension/Animal-Crossing-Music-Extension/issues/new)
and we can discuss.

Here's hoping we find the new mayor that'll give this town the bright future it
deserves. ðŸŒ¸

### Improvements

1. Certain music on special days of events (Hallowe'en, Guy Fawkes, Christmas, etc),
2. Enable the user to either choose Live K.K. songs or Aircheck songs
[Check Issue](https://github.com/JdotCarver/Animal-Crossing-Music-Extension/issues/4)
3. Improve the Download size, this extension is already big and isn't going to get smaller.
4. Add sound tones to the town tune previsualizer to more closely ressemble the one in the original game
6. <s>Dynamic Music according to local weather</s>
[Check Issue](https://github.com/JdotCarver/Animal-Crossing-Music-Extension/issues/5)
7. Add an option for ambient sounds while the music is playing
    + _20% to 30% of the current volume would be pretty sweet, a separate volume slider would be even better. Create an issue as there are background tasks to resolve first._
8. Alternate icon(s) in browser,
    + _Create an issue for the files to be prepped._
9. Redo New Leaf Snow loops,
  + _Create an issue as there are background tasks to fix first._
10.  Actually adding City Folk Rainy and Snowy Tracks!

12. Up the max volume

13. Hire an artist for UI design?
*Just thinking about it, would be a nice addition to colorize the interface a bit.*
14. Firefox and Opera Compatibility
*Preferably when the extension is close to finalized*

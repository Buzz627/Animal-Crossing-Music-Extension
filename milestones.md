### Improvements

- [ ] Certain music on special days of events (Hallowe'en, Guy Fawkes, Christmas,
   etc),
- [ ] Enable the user to either choose Live K.K. songs or Aircheck songs [Check
   Issue](https://github.com/JdotCarver/Animal-Crossing-Music-Extension/issues/4)
- [ ] Improve the Download size, this extension is already big and isn't going to
   get smaller.
- [ ] Add sound tones to the town tune previsualizer to more closely ressemble the
   one in the original game
- [ ] <s>Dynamic Music according to local weather</s> [Check
   Issue](https://github.com/JdotCarver/Animal-Crossing-Music-Extension/issues/5)
- [ ] Add an option for ambient sounds while the music is playing
  - _20% to 30% of the current volume would be pretty sweet, a separate volume
     slider would be even better. Create an issue as there are background tasks
     to resolve first._
- [ ] Alternate icon(s) in browser,
  - _Create an issue for the files to be prepped._
- [ ] Redo New Leaf Snow loops,
  - _Create an issue as there are background tasks to fix first._

- [ ] Actually adding City Folk Rainy and Snowy Tracks! (**Credit**: Google user

- [ ] Hire an artist for UI design? _Just thinking about it, would be a nice
    addition to colorize the interface a bit._
- [ ] Firefox and Opera Compatibility _Preferably when the extension is close to
    finalized_ (**Credit**: Google users [Yugo Selatrop, Comand

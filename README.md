# Animal Crossing Music (Revived) 🍀

##### This is a fork of the original [Animal Crossing Music Extension](https://github.com/animal-crossing-music-extension/Animal-Crossing-Music-Extension).

**Animal Crossing Music (Revived)** is a a fun Chrome extension for playing Animal Crossing's
music in the browser, while you work, play or browse the web! ✨

The music updates in real-time on the hour, and informs you via an optional desktop notification and customizable town tune! 🌱

## Features
### Hourly music 🕒
Listen to the corresponding hourly music from the main Animal Crossing titles:
  - Animal Crossing
  - Wild World / City Folk
  - New Leaf

Rain and snow variants are also included!

### Live Weather 🌧
You can enable Weather Detection so weather variants of the hourly music can be automatically picked according to the weather in your location!

### K.K. Slider 🎙
Listen to the mitic K.K. Slider songs! You can choose whether to keep his appearances to the usual Saturday nights, or to play his songs 24/7.

### Town Tune 🎵
You can customize your own Town Tune, which will be played every time an hour passes!


## Installation
The changes in this repository **remain unpublished** in any way. 

Ideally, we would like to update the [original extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/animal-crossing-music/fcedlaimpcfgpnfdgjbmmfibkklpioop) so project development could continue with the same user-base. Otherwise, this project will be published as a new extension.

### Local Installation
In the meantime, you can [download](https://github.com/PikaDude/Animal-Crossing-Music-Extension/archive/master.zip) the latest stable version of the project and install it locally. 

> Note that sound resources will not be included in this download. You will have to include them manually. See the [resources](#resources) section.

To install the downloaded project, do the following:
1. Go to the [Chrome Extensions Page](chrome://extensions/), which can be found under `Chrome > Settings > Extensions` 
2. Enable the `Developer Mode` switch
3. Click on `Load Unpacked`
4. Choose the unzipped project directory


### Resources
Currently, music resources are packed within the extension. As they take up a lot of space, they have been purposedly left out of the repository.

You can find the music resources in the following link:
- Google Drive: [Animal Crossing Music Extension Revived](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1QjG8QjPt_IKgzZRzmnoH8KTGwTsWSLsR)

In order to run this project locally, you will need to download the above directory and extract it under `./sounds`.

If, for some reason, you need access to the legacy music and structure, you can find them in the following link:
